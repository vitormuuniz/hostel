# HostelApp

Computer Science final paper whose goal is to show the importance of software tests, applied in an 
application that simulates a hostel reservation system.<br>
The application was created using React for front-end, SpringBoot for back-end and MySQL for data storage. 
To perform the tests was used JUnit for unity and integration tests and Selenium for end-to-end tests.

## Execution steps
To run both frontend and backend you need to execute the following steps:
  
  
### Set Environment Variables
You need to have in Windows environment Variables the folder path of java, mysql and node.

### Install lombok in your IDE
For Eclipse, you just need to open the `cmd` in the folder where you have downloaded the lombok jar and execute `java -jar lombok.jar`.<br>
A window will be shown to select eclipse folder and install.

### Backend directory
You need to open your IDE (Eclipse in the example case used above) and importing Hostel `backend` folder
as maven project:<br>
Then, in Hostel\backend\src\main\resources\application.properties you need to set the informations about your 
mysql admin user by changing the following properties:

spring.datasource.username=`username`<br>
spring.datasource.password=`password`
    
Finally, run as Java Application the main class HostelSpringBootApplication.class
  
  
### Frontend directory
You need to open your IDE (Visual Studio Code in the example case used above) and open the Hostel `frontend` folder.<br>
Then, open the IDE terminal and excute `npm install` in order to install all of dependencies and then execute `npm start`.<br>
To log into the application there are two users pre-registered:
- **ADMIN**: 
     - user: maria@email.com  
     - password: 123456
- **GUEST**: 
     - user: daniel@email.com 
     - password: 123456
    
    
## Tests Execution Steps
You just need to right click on the project and run as JUnit Test. <br>
You can also run either e2e suite class or integration and unity suite class present in 
`/backend/src/test/java/br/com/hostel/suite/` in order to run the tests separately.
 
 **obs: to run e2e tests is needed to be running both backend and frontend applications**
